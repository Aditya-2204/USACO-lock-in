# Milk Measurement

You have a list of cows and their milk production. After sorting cows by ID, you want to find the longest consecutive segment of cows whose total milk output exceeds a target T.

 * Input: N cows with (ID, milk output) pairs
 * Goal: Sort by ID, then find max-length segment with sum â‰¥ T.
